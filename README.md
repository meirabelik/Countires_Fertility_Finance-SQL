# Countires_Fertility_Finance-SQL
I wanted to explore some data in SQL, so I went to the worldbank's data repository, downloaded a huge file of tons of different information, and then cleaned it in excel (turning the '..' which signified null into just blank, and getting rid of all special characters in the column headers so it would go into Azure properly), saving one file as financial info and another as fertility info so I could practice joining them.  https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators/preview/on# .

You can see the actual code in the file SQL but here are screenshots of the tables that I was creating.
